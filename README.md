## 🧩 Algorithms Available

### 🫧 Bubble Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### ⚡ Quick Sort
An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with custom properties, animations, and a responsive grid layout)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+)

No external libraries or frameworks were used.
