## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Choose an Algorithm:** From the main page, select either Bubble Sort or Quick Sort.
2.  **Provide an Array:**
    *   Enter your own numbers (separated by spaces or commas) into the input field.
    *   Or, use the **Generate Random** button to create a random array.
3.  **Start Sorting:** Click the **Start Sorting** button.
4.  **Control the Flow:**
    *   Use **Next Step** and **Previous Step** to walk through the algorithm.
    *   Use **Complete Sort** to see it run automatically.
    *   Use **Reset** to start over with a new array.

## 🧩 Algorithms Available

### 🫧 Bubble Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### ⚡ Quick Sort
An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## 💻 Technologies Used

This project was built from scratch using:

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with custom properties, animations, and a responsive grid layout)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+)

No external libraries or frameworks were used.
